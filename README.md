## üëã Introduction

![Stephen_.png](https://github.com/steviebdesignstraining/waracle_takehome_Test/raw/main/Stephen_.png)

Hi there\! Before we blast off into the code-verse, I want to introduce myself. My name is **Stephen Bennett**, and I've been immersed in the world of testing for over **12 years**. I genuinely enjoy the development space and bringing a positive, optimistic, and adaptable spirit to any team. I'm sociable and thrive in diverse environments, working well with all personalities.

First off, I absolutely **loved** completing this take-home test\! I got a bit carried away and ended up building **two** automation frameworks: one with **Cypress**, **Playwright** and **Postman**. 

Let's dive into what I've accomplished\!

## üéØ Project Overview

This project showcases a list of music tracks and metadata. There are 14 such tracks present in the response. Each music track contains various data elements like type, id, title_list etc. The primary goal is to **automate the following test scenarios for the given endpoint.

### üîç Scope of Automation

My automated tests cover positive and negative scenarios with Cucumber so that the test scripts define and explain what each test case is performing and to prevent repeated code:


The tests are meticulously implemented using both **Cypress** and **Playwright with Cucumber**, adhering to best practices in automation and QA.

## üìã Manual Test Plan

As mentioned, I've created a detailed **manual test plan** that outlines the key user flows, cases, and scenarios that have been automated. This plan ensures that all critical functionalities of the online shop are thoroughly tested and serves as a blueprint for the automated scripts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

Getting these frameworks up and running is straightforward. Please ensure you are in the correct directory for either Cypress or Playwright when executing commands.

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    [git clone https://github.com/steviebdesignstraining/BBC_Takehome_Test.git]
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the framework directory**:

    ```bash | Cypress
    cd BBC_Takehome_Test/Cypress
    ```

    ```bash | Playwright
    cd BBC_Takehome_Test/Postman
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running Tests

Choose your preferred framework and execution method:

| Command                             | Description                                             |
| :------------------------           | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| `npx cucumber-js --format progress` |             **RUn Playwright in termindal**             |
| `npm run cypress:runner`            | **Open Cypress GUI** for interactive test development.  |
| `npm run cypress:execution`         |        **Run Cypress** tests in headless mode.          |
| `npm run test:allure`               |  **Generate & Serve Allure Report** (for Playwrigh t).  |
